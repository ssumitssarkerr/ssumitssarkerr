## Profile
I am an Oceanography graduate from **Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh**, completing my **B.Sc. (Hons) in August 2025** with a **CGPA of 3.81/4**. Currently, I am a **Research Assistant at the National Oceanographic and Maritime Institute (NOAMI)**, specializing in marine heatwaves, coastal vulnerability, flood risk mapping, and microplastic pollution. My expertise integrates **remote sensing, GIS, laboratory analysis, and community-based fieldwork** to investigate complex environmental processes. I aim to contribute to **sustainable marine resource management** and **climate resilience** in Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal region.

## Education
**B.Sc. (Hons) in Oceanography**  
Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh, 2025  
**CGPA:** 3.81/4

## Undergraduate Thesis
**"Detection and Analysis of Marine Heatwaves in the Bay of Bengal: ENSO, IOD, and Chlorophyll Dynamics"**  
- Analyzed marine heatwaves (1982–2025) using satellite-derived sea surface temperature anomalies.  
- Examined temporal patterns, intensity, and duration; assessed ENSO and IOD influence.  
- Evaluated ecological impacts through chlorophyll-a trends, showing productivity decline during El Niño events.  
- Highlighted socio-economic risks to small-scale fisheries and coastal communities.
