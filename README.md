# Hi, I'm Sumit Sarker  

I am an undergraduate student in Oceanography at Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh, graduating in August 2025 with a CGPA of 3.81/4. As a Research Assistant at the National Oceanographic and Maritime Institute (NOAMI), my work focuses on marine heatwaves, coastal vulnerability, flood mapping, and microplastic pollution. I combine remote sensing, GIS, laboratory analysis, and community-based research to address pressing environmental challenges in Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal region.

## 🎓 Undergraduate Thesis  
**Detection and Analysis of Marine Heatwaves in the Bay of Bengal: ENSO, IOD, and Chlorophyll Dynamics**  
- Analyzed sea surface temperature anomalies from 1982–2025 using satellite data.  
- Investigated marine heatwave impacts on phytoplankton productivity and fishing communities.  
- Proposed adaptive strategies to mitigate ecological and socio-economic risks.

## 🔬 Research Experience  
- **Flood Susceptibility Mapping (NOAMI)** – Remote sensing, MCDA, AHP, HEC-RAS, field validation.  
- **Coastal Vulnerability Assessment (NOAMI)** – Multi-hazard analysis, GIS, community-based participatory tools.  
- **Microplastics in Calanoid Copepods (Sandwip Channel)** – Plankton sampling, microplastic extraction, microscopy.  
- **Bioaccumulation of Microplastics in Estuarine Plankton (Lower Meghna Estuary)** – Water sampling, species separation, laboratory identification.  
- **Ecological Vulnerability of Freshwater Canals** – Water quality analysis, plankton assemblages, community awareness.
