# Hi, I'm Sumit Sarker  

I am an Oceanography graduate from Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh, where I completed my B.Sc. (Hons) in August 2025 with a CGPA of 3.81/4. Currently serving as a Research Assistant at the National Oceanographic and Maritime Institute (NOAMI), I specialize in marine heatwaves, coastal vulnerability, flood risk mapping, and microplastic pollution. My expertise lies in integrating remote sensing, GIS, laboratory analysis, and community-based fieldwork to investigate complex environmental processes. Through this multidisciplinary approach, I aim to contribute to sustainable marine resource management and climate resilience in Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal region.

## 🎓 Undergraduate Thesis  
**Detection and Analysis of Marine Heatwaves in the Bay of Bengal: ENSO, IOD, and Chlorophyll Dynamics**  

Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are increasingly recognized as one of the most pressing climate-related threats to marine ecosystems and coastal communities. This thesis identified and analyzed MHWs in the Bay of Bengal from 1982 to 2025 using satellite-derived sea surface temperature anomalies. The study examined temporal patterns, intensity, and duration of events, while also investigating the influence of large-scale climate drivers such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Ecological impacts were assessed through chlorophyll-a concentration trends, revealing significant declines in primary productivity during El Niño–associated heatwaves. In addition, the research highlighted the socio-economic risks posed to small-scale fisheries and dependent coastal populations. The findings emphasize the escalating vulnerability of the Bay of Bengal under a changing climate and underscore the need for enhanced monitoring, early-warning systems, and adaptive management strategies to safeguard both ecosystems and livelihoods.
