Sumit Sarker
Oceanography Graduate | Research Assistant | Marine & Environmental Scientist

Profile:
I am an Oceanography graduate from Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh, 
completing my B.Sc. (Hons) in August 2025 with a CGPA of 3.81/4. Currently serving as a Research 
Assistant at the National Oceanographic and Maritime Institute (NOAMI), focusing on marine 
heatwaves, coastal vulnerability, flood risk mapping, and microplastic pollution. My expertise lies 
in integrating remote sensing, GIS, laboratory analysis, and community-based fieldwork to 
investigate complex environmental processes. I aim to contribute to sustainable marine resource 
management and climate resilience in Bangladesh and the Bay of Bengal region.

Education:
B.Sc. (Hons) in Oceanography, Noakhali Science and Technology University (NSTU), Bangladesh, 2025
CGPA: 3.81/4

Undergraduate Thesis:
"Detection and Analysis of Marine Heatwaves in the Bay of Bengal: ENSO, IOD, and Chlorophyll Dynamics"
- Investigated marine heatwaves (1982–2025) using satellite-derived sea surface temperature anomalies.
- Examined temporal patterns, intensity, and duration of events and influence of ENSO and IOD.
- Evaluated ecological impacts through chlorophyll-a trends, showing productivity decline during El Niño.
- Highlighted socio-economic risks to small-scale fisheries and coastal communities.

Research Experience:
- Flood Susceptibility Mapping (NOAMI): Remote sensing, MCDA, AHP, HEC-RAS, field validation
- Coastal Vulnerability Assessment (NOAMI): Multi-hazard analysis, GIS, community-based tools
- Microplastics in Calanoid Copepods (Sandwip Channel): Plankton sampling, extraction, microscopy
- Bioaccumulation of Microplastics in Estuarine Plankton (Lower Meghna Estuary): Water sampling, lab identification
- Ecological Vulnerability of Freshwater Canals: Water quality analysis, plankton assemblages, community awareness

Field & Laboratory Skills:
- Plankton and water sampling in estuaries, canals, and coastal waters
- Water quality testing and heavy metal analysis
- Microplastic extraction from plankton, fish, and copepods
- Soil sampling and soil carbon estimation
- Field interviews, surveys, and community data collection

Technical Skills:
- Programming: Python, MATLAB, R, SPSS
- GIS & Remote Sensing: ArcGIS, QGIS, Google Earth Engine
- Hydrological & Environmental Modeling: HEC-RAS, HEC-GeoRAS
- Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis for Environmental Data
